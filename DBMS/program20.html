        <h1>Relational Algebra
        </h1>
        <p>Relational algebra is a procedural query language. It gives a step by step process to obtain the result of the query. It uses operators to perform queries.

        <h3>Types of Relational operation
        </h3>

        <b>1. Union Operation:
        </b>
        <p>Suppose there are two tuples R and S. The union operation contains all the tuples that are either in R or S or both in R & S.
        </p>
        <p>It eliminates the duplicate tuples. It is denoted by ∪.
        </p>
        <b>2. Set Intersection:
        </b>
        <p>Suppose there are two tuples R and S. The set intersection operation contains all tuples that are in both R & S.
        </p>
        <p>It is denoted by intersection ∩.
        </p>
        <b>3. Set Difference:
        </b>
        <p>Suppose there are two tuples R and S. The set intersection operation contains all tuples that are in R but not in S.
        </p>
        <p>It is denoted by intersection minus (-).
        </p>
        <b>4. Select Operation:
        </b>
        <p>The select operation selects tuples that satisfy a given predicate.
        </p>
