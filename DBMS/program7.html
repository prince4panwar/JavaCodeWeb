        <h1>Data Models
        </h1>
        <p>Data Model is the modeling of the data description, data semantics, and consistency constraints of the data. It provides the conceptual tools for describing the design of a database at each level of data abstraction. Therefore, there are following four data models used for understanding the structure of the database:

        <h1>Hierarchical Model
        </h1>
        <p>Hierarchical Model was the first DBMS model. This model organises the data in the hierarchical tree structure. The hierarchy starts from the root which has root data and then it expands in the form of a tree adding child node to the parent node. This model easily represents some of the real-world relationships like food recipes, sitemap of a website etc. Example: We can represent the relationship between the shoes present on a shopping website in the following way:

        <h1>Network Model
        </h1>
        <p>This model is an extension of the hierarchical model. It was the most popular model before the relational model. This model is the same as the hierarchical model, the only difference is that a record can have more than one parent. It replaces the hierarchical tree with a graph. Example: In the example below we can see that node student has two parents i.e. CSE Department and Library. This was earlier not possible in the hierarchical model.

        <h1>Entity-Relationship Model
        </h1>
        <p>Entity-Relationship Model or simply ER Model is a high-level data model diagram. In this model, we represent the real-world problem in the pictorial form to make it easy for the stakeholders to understand. It is also very easy for the developers to understand the system by just looking at the ER diagram. We use the ER diagram as a visual tool to represent an ER Model. ER diagram has the following three components:

        <h1>Relational Model
        </h1>
        <p>Relational Model is the most widely used model. In this model, the data is maintained in the form of a two-dimensional table. All the information is stored in the form of row and columns. The basic structure of a relational model is tables. So, the tables are also called relations in the relational model. Example: In this example, we have an Employee table.

        <a href="schema"><h1>Data model Schema and Instance</a>
        </h1>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>The data which is stored in the database at a particular moment of time is called an instance of the database.
            </li>
            <li>The overall design of a database is called schema.
            </li>
            <li>A database schema is the skeleton structure of the database. It represents the logical view of the entire database.
            </li>
            A schema contains schema objects like table, foreign key, primary key, views, columns, data types, stored procedure, etc.
     <li>A database schema can be represented by using the visual diagram. That diagram shows the database objects and relationship with each other.
    </li>
    <li>A database schema is designed by the database designers to help programmers whose software will interact with the database. The process of database creation is called data modeling.
    </li>
