        <h1>Data Independence
        </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Data independence can be explained using the three-schema architecture.
            </li>
            <li>Data independence refers characteristic of being able to modify the schema at one level of the database system without altering the schema at the next higher level.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>There are two types of data independence:
        </h4>
        <h1>1. Logical Data Independence
        </h1>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>Logical data independence refers characteristic of being able to change the conceptual schema without having to change the external schema.
            </li>
            <li>Logical data independence is used to separate the external level from the conceptual view.
            </li>
            <li>If we do any changes in the conceptual view of the data, then the user view of the data would not be affected.
            </li>
            <li>Logical data independence occurs at the user interface level.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>2. Physical Data Independence
        </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Physical data independence can be defined as the capacity to change the internal schema without having to change the conceptual schema.

            </li>
            <li>If we do any changes in the storage size of the database system server, then the Conceptual structure of the database will not be affected.
            </li>

            <li>Physical data independence is used to separate conceptual levels from the internal levels.
            </li>
            <li>Physical data independence occurs at the logical interface level.
            </li>
        </ul>
