        <h1>MySQL GROUP BY Clause
        </h1>
        <p>The MYSQL GROUP BY Clause is used to collect data from multiple records and group the result by one or more column. It is generally used in a SELECT statement.

        </p>
        <p>You can also use some aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG etc. on the grouped column.

        </p>
        <h2>Syntax</h2>
        <b>SELECT column_name(s)
            FROM table_name
            WHERE condition
            GROUP BY column_name(s)
            ORDER BY column_name(s);

            </b>
            <h2>Example</h2>
