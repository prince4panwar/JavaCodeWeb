        <h1>PL/SQL Architecture
        </h1>
        <p>In Oracle, PL/SQL (Procedural Language/SQL) is the procedural language extension to the non-procedural SQL. It combines the data manipulation power of SQL and the procedural power of standard programming languages.  PL/SQL was developed by Oracle Corporation within the early â€™90s to reinforce the capabilities of SQL. It integrates well with SQL* PLUS and other application development products of Oracle. PL/SQL is the superset of SQL. It provides SQL data manipulation commands and SQL data types. In PL/SQL, a block without any name is called Anonymous Block. PL/ SQL block consists of various functions, library, procedures, trigger, packages etc.</p>
