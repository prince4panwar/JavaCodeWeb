        <h1>MySQL Data Types
        </h1>
        <p>A Data Type specifies a particular type of data, like integer, floating points, Boolean, etc. It also identifies the possible values for that type, the operations that can be performed on that type, and the way the values of that type are stored. In MySQL, each database table has many columns and contains specific data types for each column.
        </p>
        <p>MySQL supports a lot number of SQL standard data types in various categories. It uses many different data types that can be broken into the following categories: numeric, date and time, string types data types.</p>

   <tr>
    <td>FLOAT(m,d)</td>
    <td>It is a floating-point number that cannot be unsigned. You can define the display length (m) and the number of decimals (d). This is not required and will default to 10,2, where 2 is the number of decimals, and 10 is the total number of digits (including decimals). Decimal precision can go to 24 places for a float type. It requires 2 bytes for storage.
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>DOUBLE(m,d)</td>
    <td>It is a double-precision floating-point number that cannot be unsigned. You can define the display length (m) and the number of decimals (d). This is not required and will default to 16,4, where 4 is the number of decimals. Decimal precision can go to 53 places for a double. Real is a synonym for double. It requires 8 bytes for storage.

        <p>MySQL has all essential SQL numeric data types. These data types can include the exact numeric data types (For example, integer, decimal, numeric, etc.), as well as the approximate numeric data types (For example, float, real, and double precision). It also supports BIT datatype to store bit values. In MySQL, numeric data types are categories into two types, either signed or unsigned except for bit data type.
        </p>
        <h2>String Data Types:
        </h2>
        <p>The string data type is used to hold plain text and binary data, for example, files, images, etc. MySQL can perform searching and comparison of string value based on the pattern matching such as LIKE operator, Regular Expressions, etc.
