        <h1>PL/SQL Introduction
        </h1>
        <p>PL/SQL is a block structured language that enables developers to combine the power of SQL with procedural statements.All the statements of a block are passed to oracle engine all at once which increases processing speed and decreases the traffic. </p>
        <br><br><h2>Basics of PL/SQL
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language extensions to the Structured Query Language (SQL).
            </li>
            <li> PL/SQL is a combination of SQL along with the procedural features of programming languages.
            </li>
            <li>Oracle uses a PL/SQL engine to processes the PL/SQL statements.
            </li>
            <li>PL/SQL includes procedural language elements like conditions and loops. It allows declaration of constants and variables, procedures and functions, types and variable of those types and triggers.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br><br><h2>Advantages of PL/SQL:
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>PL/SQL is basically a procedural language, which provides the functionality of decision making, iteration and many more features of procedural programming languages.
            </li>
            <li>PL/SQL can execute a number of queries in one block using single command.
            </li>
            <li>One can create a PL/SQL unit such as procedures, functions, packages, triggers, and types, which are stored in the database for reuse by applications.
            </li>
            <li>PL/SQL provides a feature to handle the exception which occurs in PL/SQL block known as exception handling block.
            </li>
            <li>Applications written in PL/SQL are portable to computer hardware or operating system where Oracle is operational.
            </li>
            <li>PL/SQL Offers extensive error checking.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br><br><h2>Disadvantages of SQL:
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>SQL doesnâ€™t provide the programmers with a technique of condition checking, looping and branching.
            </li>
            <li>SQL statements are passed to Oracle engine one at a time which increases traffic and decreases speed.
            </li>
            <li>SQL has no facility of error checking during manipulation of data.
            </li>
        </ul>
