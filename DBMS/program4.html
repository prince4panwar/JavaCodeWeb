        <h1>Database Management System
        </h1>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>Database management system is a software which is used to manage the database. For example: MySQL, Oracle, etc are a very popular commercial database which is used in different applications.</li>
              <li>  DBMS provides an interface to perform various operations like database creation, storing data in it, updating data, creating a table in the database and a lot more.</li>
               <li> It provides protection and security to the database. In the case of multiple users, it also maintains data consistency.</li>
                
        </ul>
        <h1>Characteristics of DBMS
        </h1>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>It uses a digital repository established on a server to store and manage the information.
            </li>
            <li>It can provide a clear and logical view of the process that manipulates data.
                It can provide a clear and logical view of the process that manipulates data.
            </li>
            <li>DBMS contains automatic backup and recovery procedures.
            </li>
            <li>It can reduce the complex relationship between data.
            </li>
            <li>It is used to support manipulation and processing of data.
            </li>
            <li>It is used to provide security of data.
            </li>
            <li>It can view the database from different viewpoints according to the requirements of the user.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Advantages of DBMS
        </h1>
        <ul type="circle"><li>
            Controls database redundancy: It can control data redundancy because it stores all the data in one single database file and that recorded data is placed in the database.

        </li>
    <li>
        Data sharing: In DBMS, the authorized users of an organization can share the data among multiple users.

    </li>
<li>
    Easily Maintenance: It can be easily maintainable due to the centralized nature of the database system.

</li>
<li>
    Reduce time: It reduces development time and maintenance need.

</li>
<li>
    Backup: It provides backup and recovery subsystems which create automatic backup of data from hardware and software failures and restores the data if required.

</li>
<li>
    multiple user interface: It provides different types of user interfaces like graphical user interfaces, application program interfaces

</li></ul>
<h1>Disadvantages of DBMS
</h1>
<ul type="circle">
    <li>
        Cost of Hardware and Software: It requires a high speed of data processor and large memory size to run DBMS software.

    </li>
    <li>
        Size: It occupies a large space of disks and large memory to run them efficiently.

    </li>
    <li>
        Complexity: Database system creates additional complexity and requirements.

    </li>
    <li>
        Higher impact of failure: Failure is highly impacted the database because in most of the organization, all the data stored in a single database and if the database is damaged due to electric failure or database corruption then the data may be lost forever.
