        </h1>
        <p>The show or list table is very important when we have many databases that contain various tables. Sometimes the table names are the same in many databases; in that case, this query is very useful. We can get the number of table information of a database using the following statement:

        </b>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <b>mysql>SHOW TABLES;  
        </b>
