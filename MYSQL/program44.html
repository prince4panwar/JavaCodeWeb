        <h1>MySQL Foreign Key
        </h1>
        <p>The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.
        </p>
        <p>A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.
        </p>
        <p>The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table.
        </p>
        <h2>Syntax</h2>
        <b>[CONSTRAINT constraint_name]  
            FOREIGN KEY [foreign_key_name] (col_name, ...)  
            REFERENCES parent_tbl_name (col_name,...)  
        </b>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <b>create table table2(roll int,status varchar(10),constraint fk_roll foreign key(roll) references table1(roll));</b>
