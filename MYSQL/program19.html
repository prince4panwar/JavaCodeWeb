        <h1>MySQL View
        </h1>
        <p>In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.

            A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.
            
            You can add SQL statements and functions to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table.
            
            A view is created with the CREATE VIEW statement.
            
            </p>
