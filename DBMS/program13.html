        </p>

        </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Strong Entity Type
            </li>
            <li>Weak Entity Type
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Strong Entity Type:</b> Strong entity are those entity types which has a key attribute. The primary key helps in identifying each entity uniquely. It is represented by a rectangle. In the above example, Roll_no identifies each element of the table uniquely and hence, we can say that STUDENT is a strong entity type.

        </p>
        <p>The Entity Relationship Diagram represents the weak entity type using double rectangles. Below is the ERD of the weak entity type:
