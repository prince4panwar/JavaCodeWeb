        <h1>What is Database
        </h1>
        <p>The database is a collection of inter-related data which is used to retrieve, insert and delete the data efficiently. It is also used to organize the data in the form of a table, schema, views, and reports, etc.
            For example: The college Database organizes the data about the admin, staff, students and faculty etc.
           <br> Using the database, you can easily retrieve, insert, and delete the information.
           <br><h1>Characteristics of database approach</h1><br>

<h3> 1.Self-Describing Nature of a Database system</h3> The database system contains not only the database itself but also a complete definition or description of the database structure and constraints.This definition is stored is the DBMS catalog, which contains information like structure, type, and storage format of each data.
<h3> 2.Insulation between program and data</h3> In database systems, the data is stored independently from the programs that access it. That is, you can modify data without need to any changes in the programs this property is called program operation independence.
<h3> 3.Support of multiple views of the data</h3> Database is shared among multiple users, each user may require different information based on their requirement from the database. each user requirement is the view of database.
<h3> 4.Sharing of data transaction processing</h3> A multiuser DBMS allows access to database simultaneously by more than one user at the same time using concurrency control software.
<h3> 5.Security</h3> features like multiple views offer security to some extent. DBMS offers methods to improve security by using constraints while entering data into the database and retrieving the same at a later stage.
<h3> 6.Query language</h3> query language makes it more efficient to retrieve and manipulate data. user can apply as many and as different filtering option as required.
