        <h1>MySQL Features
        </h1>
        <p>MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) based on the SQL (Structured Query Language) queries. It is one of the most popular languages for accessing and managing the records in the table. MySQL is open-source and free software under the GNU license. Oracle Company supports it.
        </p>
       <br> <h3><b>1. Easy to Use</h3>
        </b>
        <p>MySQL is considered easy to use among RDBMS. It works with basic SQL and, given its maturity and adoption, there is abundant documentation available.
        </p>
        <br><h3><b>2. Secure</h3>
        </b>
        <p>MySQL's maturity also lends itself to security. It's regularly updated, has a vibrant developer community, and, because of it's wide adoption within the enterprise, many CVE patches are released before the CVE is announced. These factors combine to make MySQL a stable and secure choice among RDBMS.
        </p>
        <br><h3><b>3. Open Source</h3>
        </b>
        <p>The community edition of MySQL is enterprise ready, and supported by a GNU General Public License. For users who want access to equitable proprietary functionality of MySQL without the added price tag, there are other options within the ecosystem — like MariaDB — that can add similar levels of functionality and beyond.
        </p>
        <br><h3><b>4. Scalable</h3>
        </b>
        <p>MySQL is highly scalable for an RDBMS, with a wide range of options not covered in this blog that allow for tuning, customizing and enhancing your MySQL experience. 
        </p>
        <br><h3><b>5. Reliable</h3>
        </b>
        <p>MySQL is reliable — not just from a data perspective, but from a development perspective. It's mature, it has regular releases, patches, and an entrenched developer community that works with it. This makes it a safe choice compared to newer, less mature RDBMS options.
        </p>
